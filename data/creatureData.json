Growing up as a member of one of the many nomadic tribes in the inlands of Mycorzha, her childhood introduced her to the many incredible sights and experiences that are the essence of her island home. Her parents were spinners, of both tales and thread; her father creating beautiful tapestries and her mother sharing with her the epic songs and sagas of Mycorzhan life. Inheriting their artistic bent, and fascinated by the world around her, Amani still holds a deep reverence for her island home and its flora and fauna. During her many wanderings as a youngster, her daydreamings wound up being crash-landed upon by a peculiar little bird named Indie. Making fast friends with the talkative messenger, she found her horizons and interests expanding, and the next step of her life had her moving to Luna Valley, where she became a painter and pictograph artist. She loves to create in all kind of forms, and has a rich, internal life that those close to her are always joyful to participate in."

          "bio": "A native of the Isles, Glinda wears her old age and status of 'elder' with pride. She is well known in Luna Valley, Cove City, and various parts besides; those who run in Cove City's academic circles have come across frequent publications and references to one 'Glinda Nelinsce Tortuga'. Now thoroughly retired from the distant heights of the Academy, Glinda has ensconced herself in Luna Valley and pre-occupies herself with raising her children, reading, writing, and being a general force in the community. Originally from the Hazelmoss Woods, to the south of Luna Valley, Glinda was known for her incredible knowledge of local flora and fungi. Her insatiable curiosity and drive to learn led her inevitably to acceptance in the Mystveil Academy of Sciences, where she swiftly became a rising star. Often seen in public forum and debates in the Cove City parks, she caught the interest of faculty even as her own eyes snagged on a somewhat haughty black cat, known as Jack, who was a similar force in public discourse. The two fell in together, pushing each other to further their own knowledge and expand the vast Academy archives. Flames that burn bright, burn out all too quickly, however. Glinda, always with a plan in mind, knew that she wanted a family; an idea that Jack scoffed at, not wanting to be tied down. They parted ways, and Glinda retired from public life to raise a family in the nurturing hills and fields of Luna Valley. Despite her own pronunciations that she is 'done' with academia, she has become a prolific writer of non-fiction and treatises, and her pieces are regularly published in various Cove City gazettes. She spends her days writing letters, raising her two rambunctious kids, and taking naps."
