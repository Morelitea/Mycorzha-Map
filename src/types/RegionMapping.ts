          content: `Luna Valley rests in the crater like cliffs that are at the edge of the crescent mountains. The huge glacial peaks surrounding it do well at preventing bad weather, and so there is rarely a stormy night to worry about, with the sun shining 300+ days of the year overhead. The volcanic soil from the mountains surrounding it is filled with nutrients and food grows here freely and with great ease. Because of this most of the population of the Isles resides here or in Cove City nearby. So as not to disturb the top soil many who live here burrow underground to build permanent residences, finding the cool break from the sun refreshing, and the smell of the earth a comfort at the end of a long day. Much of the valley is covered in wild grasses and flowers, with a constant buzz of honey bees working away. Small pockets of fruit trees and bushes are interspersed throughout. There are many small creeks which stream throughout the area, all feeding into the main river network.\n\nFable falls, where the water feeds the river from the glaciers, is a sight to behold. Huge and roaring, anything nearby is covered in a fine mist, the river below deep from centuries of the raging water pounding against the ground. Luna Valley is deceptively large, and traveling from one end to the other takes 4-5 days so those who live this far upstream place trade goods in tight water weaved baskets and send them down to Coral Cap Cove to be retrieved and traded for them in exchange for whatever they indicate on the conveniently naturally waterproof mushroom paper. A pully system is erected along the rivers, which brings the baskets back up on hooks filled with the traded goods. The vine ropes holding the baskets are pulled along with a simple water wheel (think like a ski lift system). Occasionally mischievous little ones try to ride in the baskets, a fun past time until you stay in one a little too long and get lost. Some of the creeks through the valley are large enough to carry smaller baskets, which those who live along the riverbed will transfer into the heavier duty baskets to send along for trade. A few creatures do this full time, hiking to deliver the traded goods back to those who live on the edges of the valley.\n\nLocals here heavily value "doers" and so many here create primarily functional arts: blankets, baskets, pictography tiles, and so on. There is abundant natural clay, along with permanent settlements, and so brick and pottery is common. Due to the large river there are many river creatures in the area and a favorite food here is fish. The culture results in many desiring to find a problem and "solve it", with many tool inventors finding ways to work with the land and build creative new solutions. This can get out of hand with the young ones, who don't always value the traditional ways in which the elderly here tell them to temper their greed. Certainly after they invent the next amazing whosamawatsit they will all see that we are just making things *more efficient*.`,

Like many cultures which rely on a key water source funerals are held by boat crafts sent out to sea. Creatures are wrapped in a clean mushroom cloth and adorned with their favorite teas, flowers, and other things from life. The River goddess is believed to carry you down Luna and into the mysts, a place "in between" which cannot be accessed by the living.

As one of the few places with permanent residences, some going back many generations in one family, the homes found here tend to be very self expressive from the many years of careful cultivation. Simple braids made from old vines pulled from the river shores are used as accents, and river baskets that once carried trade goods but sprung a leak are reused as plant pots where many grow delightful herbs and flowers not from the valley for year round enjoyment.`,

Traditionally in Luna valley a blessing is baked (or steeped) into the dishes you prepare and thought to bring good (or bad...) luck to those who partake in your food. This is mostly taken as a silly thought, but its not abnormal to blame a bit of bad luck on your neighbors cooking in a playful jab.
