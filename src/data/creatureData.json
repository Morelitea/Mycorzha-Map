Growing up as a member of one of the many nomadic tribes in the inlands of Mycorzha, her childhood introduced her to the many incredible sights and experiences that are the essence of her island home. Her parents were spinners, of both tales and thread; her father creating beautiful tapestries and her mother sharing with her the epic songs and sagas of Mycorzhan life. Inheriting their artistic bent, and fascinated by the world around her, Amani still holds a deep reverence for her island home and its flora and fauna. During her many wanderings as a youngster, her daydreamings wound up being crash-landed upon by a peculiar little bird named Indie. Making fast friends with the talkative messenger, she found her horizons and interests expanding, and the next step of her life had her moving to Luna Valley, where she became a painter and pictograph artist. She loves to create in all kind of forms, and has a rich, internal life that those close to her are always joyful to participate in."

          "bio": "A native of the Isles, Glinda wears her old age and status of 'elder' with pride. She is well known in Luna Valley, Cove City, and various parts besides; those who run in Cove City's academic circles have come across frequent publications and references to one 'Glinda Nelinsce Tortuga'. Now thoroughly retired from the distant heights of the Academy, Glinda has ensconced herself in Luna Valley and pre-occupies herself with raising her children, reading, writing, and being a general force in the community. Originally from the Hazelmoss Woods, to the south of Luna Valley, Glinda was known for her incredible knowledge of local flora and fungi. Her insatiable curiosity and drive to learn led her inevitably to acceptance in the Mystveil Academy of Sciences, where she swiftly became a rising star. Often seen in public forum and debates in the Cove City parks, she caught the interest of faculty even as her own eyes snagged on a somewhat haughty black cat, known as Jack, who was a similar force in public discourse. The two fell in together, pushing each other to further their own knowledge and expand the vast Academy archives. Flames that burn bright, burn out all too quickly, however. Glinda, always with a plan in mind, knew that she wanted a family; an idea that Jack scoffed at, not wanting to be tied down. They parted ways, and Glinda retired from public life to raise a family in the nurturing hills and fields of Luna Valley. Despite her own pronunciations that she is 'done' with academia, she has become a prolific writer of non-fiction and treatises, and her pieces are regularly published in various Cove City gazettes. She spends her days writing letters, raising her two rambunctious kids, and taking naps."

Something about the woods and the fields spoke to her, and where her sister was headstrong and brash, Fiona quickly learned how to listen – to the woods, to her family and those around her. Where Rhys found herself pulled away from the Wood, Fiona found herself drawn back towards it.\n\nWhen Rhys left, Fiona of course knew it was a long time in coming, and was there to soothe the upset and the concern of the greater family and relations. With her older sister now on poor terms with her relatives, everyone started to look to Fiona to take up the mantle of the family, and she settled into it with a comfortable grace, directing the care of the ancestral wood with skill and patience. Under her care, her family’s tending of the woodland flowers and beehives bloomed and blossomed – quite literally! – and the hives buzzed with activity just the same as her homestead.\n\nNow firmly settled into her budding role of the next family matriarch, Fiona finds herself musing more and more on what it means to be family. Despite concerns she has reached out to her sister once again, their relationship a tumultuous but loving one, and Rhys has even visited a time or two, tempting Fiona to do the same. Fiona has thus far declined, unsure of herself and her place beyond the woods in which she has lived her entire life. Here she moves with confidence and surety in herself and her place in things, and shows just as much cunning as her sister ever has, deftly hidden behind the blooms and blossoms of her personality."

Hercules, or “Herc” to some, grew up in a warm and happy home, and if it was small (consisting of only him, his mother, and his sister), still it never lacked for support or the camaraderie of the local community, who pulled together to make sure that Hercules’s mother never lacked assistance in the raising of her children. Nothing, however, could have prepared the family or their community for the disaster that was to come.\n\nAs Hercules and his sister entered early adulthood, and his sister was being guided and taught the ways of the Hazelmoss matriarchy, a wasting disease crept into the Rubeus household. First his mother, then his sister fell ill, confined to bed as an increasingly frantic Hercules fought to care for them. Messages flew fast and thick between the homestead and points north; experts consulted, visited, shook their heads. As hope dwindled, many in the community tried to take Herc aside, comfort and console him, but ultimately discuss what was to come. Refusal on Hercules’s part gave way to pleading, and finally despair as his family was called back by the Isles.\n\nWhat followed was a period of desolation; Hercules attended the funeral in a daze, numb to the world around him and the sudden weight of responsibility as the last of the family line. He shut himself away from the world, refusing to leave his bed or his home even as the Wood began to reclaim it around him. Most agree that he would have swiftly followed his mother and sister down into the dark and the loam, if not for Kova. A resident of Cove City and Speaker for the Isles, Kova had been one of many called upon to consult on the Rubeus family illness. At a loss to help the mother and daughter, Kova turned to the son in an attempt to provide comfort in such a difficult time. Even when it became clear that there was nothing to be done, Kova stayed. Through the darkest time in Hercules’s life, Kova was there every day - making sure he ate, slept, helping him through the enormity of his grief. The other bear’s steady presence meant everything to Hercules, and eventually friendship, companionship, and loved blossomed between the two of them.\n\nAs the two settled into their new lives, now several years on from the tragedy that brought them together, Hercules has begun to think more and more of family, and of continuing the Rubeus name. Unsure of himself, and striking out against the matriarchal traditions of the Wood, Hercules is nonetheless determined to become the new head of the Rubeus homestead, and to raise children of his own. With Kova’s full support, the two have begun to forge social connections within the Wood and without, tackling the daunting task of growing a family from the barest, tiniest seed."

One of if not the oldest living resident of the Isles, Midge has seen, in her own words, “more seasons and hardships than I care to recount, and more’n anyone should stomach!” Widely considered by the residents of Hazelmoss as the Matriarch of the Wood, most major decisions that affect the region wind their way to Midge’s favorite rocking chair, along with those coming with gossip or seeking advice on everything from the season’s harvest to what color to wear to the next festival day. Most are shoo’d on their way with a grumpy comment on the behavior of “youngsters”, but Midge has her favorites who she takes into her care and confidences.\n\nNobody except Midge herself can now recall a much, much younger porcupine, just setting out to find her place in a world wider and more awe-inspiring than she ever could have guessed. Drawn onward by a wanderlust nobody now would ever ascribe to her, Midge set out from her home in Hazelmoss aboard one of her family’s merchant ships setting out with a hold full of tea leaves to parts Beyond. The way Midge tells it, what followed was nigh on a decade of trial and hardship, from facing the rage of ocean storms to the attention of pirates and other, stranger encounters. How much of her tales are real and how much are made up to scare the younger generations is unclear; her children and grandchildren are pretty sure that her story of being shipwrecked for nearly three months is exaggerated, and nobody has ever seen the metal vessels that she describes haunting her crew through the Mysts. Midge swears by every word however, and grouses at any who question her about respecting their ancestors.\n\nWeary after long travels, Midge returned home to oversee her family’s ancestral homesteads and to rest and support her family. She quickly found herself the focus of the Theacen clan’s attention, her wisdom and experience combined with her sharp wit and blunt, stubborn nature slicing through complications and obstacles. Wielding respect for the traditions of the Wood and plain ornery go-gettedness in equal measure, Midge steered her family, then her community, and then the whole of the Wood with the same steady hand with which she captained her ships.\n\nHaving passed the bulk of her responsibilities to her relations and others who have impressed her with their effort and skill, Midge spends most of her current days sitting in the warm sun by the family shrine, knitting in her favorite rocking chair while others come to pay their respects. Those who approach might hear her carrying on a spirited conversation with her siblings or mentors who have passed on, grousing at someone for wasting her time, or pulling one of a horde of youngsters onto her lap to tell them tales of the Woods and hills and trees. While she has no intention of leaving before her time, she knows the day will soon come when the Isles were call to her, and she feels nothing but comfort in knowing she will soon be able to rest."

Preston's fixation with his tinkering and inattentiveness to his surroundings were both very notable, and his attendance at the Academy was all but assumed by his family and those around him. Preston's brilliance did not disappoint, and it was with breath-taking excitement that he started attending his first classes.\n\nPreston absolutely shone during his studies at the Academy, his radical thinking and fixation on detail catapulting his ideas into the spotlight. Meanwhile, the academic structure and the support of the faculty provided Preston with much needed insight into who he was and what he needed in order to feel at ease with himself and others. Preston thrived, and his inventions, if small, began making big waves both within the Academy and without.\n\nNow graduated, Preston devotes much of his time to study and tinkering, absent-mindedly collecting and discarding ideas as the whimsy strikes him. Foremost in his mind is always the Academy however, and many of his projects are designed to help the institution and its students, whom he loves deeply. Preston's latest studies have been focused on accessibility, and the needs of the many other students who, like him, either move, sense, or think differently; the recent invention of his \"press\" has caused an absolute uproar in academic circles. This has led to Preston gaining quite a bit of prominence in Cove City, a fact which he, seemingly, is unaware of. He spends his time \"pressing\" every book, treatise, and essay he can get his paws on, tinkering on his inventions, and rummaging through local garbage bins, on the hunt for parts and materials for whatever he's cooking up next."

          "bio": "A lover of nature, Nalin grew up surrounded by the natural beauty of the Isles. A child of the Isles, adopted into one of the nomadic clans who move about Mycorzha's interior, the young rabbit was awe-struck at diversity and vibrancy of the world around them. As they grew and learned, they also taught, shepherding the younger children and pointing out aspects of flora and fungi, re-telling the stories of the clan, and guiding their charges as best they could. As the clan moved, and Nalin came into contact with other, less transitory denizens of the Isles, they began to puzzle over questions; how did other young children learn, so tied to one place as they were? Did they understand the vast web of life that encompassed the Isles? Nalin had discovered a quiet joy in teaching, both the children in their care as well as others who sought them out for counsel or advice. Always seeking to go where they felt most needed, when Cove City sent out a call for creatures who truly knew the Isles, Nalin decided to answer, packing up and heading to the place where the connection to the nature of the Isles was most tenuous. Upon arriving, the Cove City Council detailed an incredibly ambitious plan – to design and build the seven Great Parks, to bring the wonder of the land to the citizens. Nalin was awed at the shear scale of the project, but set themselves to work.\n\nThe rural rabbit was quickly overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle of Cove City, finding themselves anxious, on edge, jumping at sudden noises and strange smells. Only in their work on the great city Parks did they feel at peace, and with their usual quiet enthusiasm they poured themselves and their love for the Isles into every inch of them. Once completed, the Parks filled them with the same wonder they always felt, but also mild dismay - the Parks lacked for caretakers who truly knew and understood them, and while some few knew the land and its growing things, fewer still could teach the city-dwelling children of their heritage, or guide them in the ways of the Isles. Without care and patience, the Parks would become mere attractions, entertaining but pale reflections of the Isles. Filled with resolve, Nalin set to the task.\n\nNow, Nalin is one of the most well known, and most sought, natural guides and caretakers of the Parks. They teach children and adults alike the love of nature, and the care that citizens of the Isles must show their home in order to nurture and support it, as it does them. Often found sitting in quiet contemplation, Nalin encourages all who come to them to take time to pause, to breathe, to let go the worries and cares of tomorrow to find quiet joy in the now."

And to this day, academic scuttle-butt tells stories of the black cat who exploded suddenly onto the scene but a generation ago. Freshly arrived from the Fern  Leaf Forest, Jack never formally applied to the Academy, nor any of the other institutions of learning in the City. Nevertheless, his ideas found fertile ground, and library doors were thrown open to him in an effort to woo his attendance. Jack mostly kept his own council, for a time, but his eye was caught fast by another up and coming student. Glinda and he struck a spark which roared into a dancing inferno of companionship, study, and treatises which rocked the City's academic circles for nearly two years.\n\nAs fast as he had come though, Jack seemingly vanished once again. He and Glinda had a falling out, their relationship collapsing like a spring-time avalanche; Jack ignored letters, failed to attend lectures and salon gatherings, and eventually simply... disappeared. Rumors swirled of an expedition mounted to the north, to prove a stubbornly held theory on the formation of the Isles. As winter settled in, many figured Jack lost to the ice and snows of the northern plains. So it was to the surprise of all when, nearly a year later, Jack appeared suddenly once again in their midst, tugging a load of glowing mushrooms and refusing to share where he'd been. As soon as he had sold his cargo and re-supplied, he disappeared again, as mysteriously as he had arrived.\n\nWherever Jack goes, he re-appears like a bad habit every autumn-time, pulling a cargo of glowcaps, jack-o-lanterns, and other strange fungi from the north and full of spooky stories to scare off any of the curious. He keeps tight lipped about where he spends the rest of his time, and none who have attempted to follow him out of town when he leaves have managed to track him beyond a few miles."

All these things are true, but almost despite himself, Kai has found his own place and his own people, as much as he would never admit it.\n\nIn keeping with tradition, Kai was kicked out of his home pod as a young male and forced to fend for himself. One of the largest predators in the seas, Kai at first tried to throw his weight around, but he quickly found that even an orca had to watch his flukes, alone in the big wide sea. Chased off by dolphin gangs, testy giant turtles, and once by an enraged shrimp and their mates, Kai was starting to lose a bit of his bluster when he happened upon the entrance to a small, rocky cove. A ship full of land-folk was attempting to make passage, and Kai puffed up immediately, claiming to know the waters. Taking charge, he guided the ship into the rocky inlet only to discover the way twisted, turned, and was criss-crossed with odd currents that threatened to dash his charge on the rocks. Through a mixture of his skills in navigating, persuasive words, and a dash of pure dumb luck, Kai eventually guided the ship true. They arrived in a sheltered lagoon of twisting coral and shaggy algae growths, and Kai came nose to nose with the pirates of Mossy Cup.\n\nWhile that first meeting started off on the wrong fin, Kai’s bravado held the crews at bay long enough for an elderly and ailing leatherback turtle to shove aside all the “young hot-heads” to get a look at the orca. The turtle introduced himself as Kanoa, and gave grudging respect to Kai’s skills - indeed, nobody had ever navigated the route from sea to Lagoon on their first try! Kai’s bluster at the accomplishment was short-lived enough, as Kanoa cuffed him smartly and told him to “batten it down” if he was going to be the old turtle’s new mate. Kai startled but accepted the offer to join the crews, mindful of the loneliness that had plagued his journey thus far.\n\nYears on now, Kai is a fixture of life in Mossy Cup Lagoon, and has taken over piloting duties from Kanoa. While he denies it, it’s an open secret amongst all the crews that Kai dotes on the old turtle, seeking approval with nets full of jellyfish and tales of his new record times in navigating the reefs and rocks. To everyone else, Kai is the image of a hulking apex predator, and is happy to throw his weight around."
