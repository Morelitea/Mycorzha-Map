Growing up as a member of one of the many nomadic tribes on the vast plains of Mycorzha, her childhood introduced her to the many incredible sights and experiences that are the essence of her island home. Her parents were spinners, of both tales and thread; her father creating beautiful tapestries and her mother sharing with her the epic songs and sagas of Mycorzhan life. Inheriting their artistic bent, and fascinated by the world around her, Amani still holds a deep reverence for her island home and its flora and fauna.\n\nDuring her many wanderings as a youngster, her daydreamings wound up being crash-landed upon by a peculiar little bird named Indie. Making fast friends with the talkative messenger, she found her horizons and interests expanding, and the next step of her life had her moving to Luna Valley, where she became a painter and pictograph artist. She loves to create in all kind of forms, and has a rich, internal life that those close to her are always joyful to participate in.",
