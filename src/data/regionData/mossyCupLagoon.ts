    "Beneath the icy northern waters, the Mossy Cup Lagoon is a hidden burst of life. Bright summer colors peak out in the tide pools of the lagoon, bright oranges, blues, greens, and maroons of the many oceanic critters of Mycorzha contrast against the pale cliffs of the White Plateau. The deep blues of the water shift to crystalline turquoise in the shallows, revealing the coral-like formations that cling to the sheltered rock faces. Against the stark white cliffs of the plateau, the lagoon is a living jewel, pulsing with the colors of a world both fragile and fierce",

Many who reside in the Lagoon are ocean dwelling critters, often going their whole lives without ever interacting with the land folk. This geographic separation resulted in unique values not shared by the rest of the Isles. The lagoon critters are both far more superstitious and far more willing to look past prior grievances should luck appear to be in your favor. As such they freely trade with the Banished, as well as the rest of the Isles. After all, the land folk cannot banish an orca to the Plateau for such offenses. This makes the Lagoon the hub of the black market on Mycorzha, rich with strange mushrooms, spices, and other trades from all around the Isles.`,

This is a mark which immediately results in you being removed from the Lagoon, often quite violently, as it is believed to be a curse from the Isles itself and sure to bring doom upon all who are near it.`,
