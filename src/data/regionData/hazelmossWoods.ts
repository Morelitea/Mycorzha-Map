    "Nestled between the southern lakes and the upper delta of the Luna River this deciduous forest is filled with American chestnuts, oaks, and maples as far as the eye can see. The Hazelmoss Woods are a breathtaking celebration of nature’s golden hour, where the world is forever draped in the warm, inviting hues of autumn. This deciduous forest is a kaleidoscope of amber, russet, and ochre tones, with light woods that glow as though kissed by a perpetual sunset. The air is rich with the earthy aroma of fallen leaves, and sunlight filters through the canopy in soft, dappled patterns, casting a magical glow over the leafy forest floor.",

      content: `The Hazelmoss Woods is in the southern part of the Isles,where the warm air and humidity of the marshes not far away keep the area relatively damp and always smelling vaguely like petrichor after a rainstorm. Rolling hills throughout the Woods keep most of the residences safely away from the flood zones of the Luna Valley River delta that streams its way through. As a deciduous forest there is always an underbed beneath the trees of old leaves, sprouted through with mushrooms and cultivated plant life. The hills provide ample drainage while the delta and humid air provide plenty of water allowing for some unique plant life to grow well here in both moist and dry soils. This is why it is the area of choice for the few in Mycorzha who dedicate their lives to plants and agriculture.

As with all the Isles, Hazelmoss Woods is a cultivated food forest with various nut trees, berry bushes, medicinal herbs, and anything else you could imagine cultivated for the best harvests. However, some choose to reside here their whole lives working to grow things, using different systems or developing new plants. Often a family affair, these “farms” typically specialize and work together to grow unique crops, like the imported tea trees grown the by the Theacen family or the bursting unique colors of the specialty flowers cultivated by the Asteria family. Land is shared freely and so the nomadic clans often come through during large harvest times both for their own harvest and to lend a helping hand preserving these specialty crops for the families to use for trade.

Not many live here year-round as the winters here, like for any deciduous forest, are dormant and lack easy access to food. Cottages are often too far apart to see each other across the way, but all the same somehow the neighbors seem to know all the latest gossip. Like most of the Isles, Hazelmoss Woods homes are often multi-generational, sheltering and teaching the whole family - an organized chaos often overseen by the family matriarch. Families pass down their knowledge and care of the land to the next generation, along with memories shared so that family may live on forever. Each family cottage in Hazelmoss cherishes this ancestral knowledge, and so each family often also maintains a family shrine where they remember loved one’s past and give a portion of each year’s harvests.`,
