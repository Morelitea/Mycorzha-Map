    "Sheer cliff faces end the Crescent Mountains and join Luna Valley below, the Selene Cliffs are home to graceful birds and winds that carry whispered songs of the skies. This collection captures the regal beauty of their world with sepia-brown tones, gleaming gold accents, and intricate, flowing motifs that echo the majesty of feathered wings in flight. While treacherous for most the cliffs the perfect home for the many birds in the Luna Valley region, along with some other fun creatures like mountain goats that can traverse the difficult terrain.",

      content: `The Selene Cliffs are known for their strict and traditional ways that are reinforced by their tight knit community. Birds do not tend to "leave the nest" unless it is to build a family roost of their own, leading to multi generational homes as the norm of the cliffs. Parents tend to be deeply involved in their kids lives, seeing it as their personal duty to ensure their child's place in the community and their future success. Sometimes this can become overbearing as the parents chatter amongst themselves to keep all the hatchlings in line leaving little room for mistakes without a witness and an inevitable flight back home with your mother cawing into your ears.The birds of the Isles are a heavily spiritual people and each home holds a dedicated shrine to whomever they declare the family deity that watches over them. These shrines are often hand carved into the cliff faces inside their homes and are always adorned with various "bird gifts" that were found from that day. Bits of string, flowers, fruits, maybe a really shiny rock or three, all diligently organized and cleaned as needed with a few careful pecks. The birds worship more than just the Mysts and the Isles, believing there are many more gods that bless their homes and dictate their fate.Others such as mountain goats and bighorn sheep may also live on the cliff, often following the bird pantheon as well to adapt to a culture primarily run by morning bird song and nosy neighbors.

Carved into the side of all of the cliff faces of Luna Valley are the cave dweller homes of the Selene Cliffs. Nearly all belong to bird
families that enjoy it for its central location and year round views with great winds. Like most "permanent" settlements in the Luna Valley many carved homes are generational, while others are transient nests by
default used by migratory families or travelers. Many ladders and pulleys stretch along the cliffs for visitors. Often the homes are adorned with windchimes or colorful nest decor (as birds tend to do). During the fall holidays everyone hangs silver bells outside, making a magical sound through the whole valley. It is said that when the bells chime from the winds outside, your loved one is visiting home once more.

As the birds of Mycorzha live naturally a mix of both nomadic and permanent residential life many roost their home here and travel as they wish by flight. It is not uncommon for nests to be empty for a seasonal harvest when the tea leaves ripen in the southern Hazelmoss woods. The different perspective of the Isles allows the bird to travel past the Crescent Mountain range while other cannot, so many have ventured far enough north to see the Frostfire forest and have witnessed some of the strange things that live in those woods (although never up close, everyone knows landing to the north is a death wish). Distant views of strange monsters gave way to stories over time and the birds gossiped amongst themselves until the stories became an extensive religious pantheon that nearly all birds of the Isles follow. Carvings of the many gods the birds pray to are found throughout the cliff faces, and nearly every home has a dedicated shrine to the deity of their given house that is adorned with fruit and flowers.`,

"May Liora (Goddess of Fate) be kind to you" might be something said to someone who is venturing into a risky plan. A bird that does not enjoy the light of dawn might mumble curses to Elanna (Goddess of Light). If a new baby is born the bird's would say "Nimmireth (Goddess of Fertility) has blessed your home and Brigha (Goddess of Family) has warmed your fires." Those not from the cliffs often don't understand who these gods particularly are, but still smile at the blessings all the same.`,
