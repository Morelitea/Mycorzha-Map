    "A never ending winter the plateau is defined by the white, blue, and silver tones of ice. The White Plateau is in the far north west of the Isles where creatures do not travel for nothing grows here and the harsh cold winds never cease. Beneath snow is but more white, the ground a rough pumice like stone drained of all color. The outer edge a harsh cliff to the ocean beneath makes access to the waters below impossible. The mountains themselves have scant plant life to survive on, covered mostly in deadly glaciers and a snow bank covering the western slopes due to the winds. The eastern slopes of the mountains have some richness still to them, protected by the evergreens from the Fern Leaf Forest, what little plant life remains grows under patches of snow until reaching the edge of the glaciers.",

      content: `The creatures who live in the Plateau are nearly all one of the Banished. Many live as close as possible to the edge, along the border watched by guards separating them from Luna Valley and the south of the Isles. Here the Banished have built a walled home for their community to protect from the harsh winds and sometimes even harsher creatures, for some are Banished for crimes that make them undesirable even for survival in such a desolate place. Many who reside in the walled encampments hope to work towards reentry to Greater Mycorzha and an easier life once again, but some choose to stay having found themselves a new life here. Stranger still are those who choose to live in the mountains and plateau simply because they find things a little easier when left to themselves, and it is one of the few places on the Isles that will guarantee you will not be disturbed by pesky things like neighbors or "making friends".

Survival here unlike the rest of the Isles depends on daily hard and often intense work. Without rich soil to grow on or warm weather safe from frost any food here either comes through trade on the Black Market, difficult foraging trecks to the mountain range for minimal plant life, or from the painstakingly built and cared for greenhouses in the Banished encampments. If you don't work, you don't eat, plain as that.

The challenge of survival is only made more difficult as those among the Banished are not known for their community building skills. Landing here is a last resort for the Isles, a punishment only fit for those who refused all teachings and caused serious harm to either others or the Isles itself. Birds guard day and night so that one may not return to the south. Even so, for those who work hard in the communities here and show a change of heart creatures can petition to revoke their banishment.`,
