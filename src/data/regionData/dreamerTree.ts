    "The Dreamer Tree stands tall at the heart of the Isles, its roots stretching deep beside the serene waters of Dreamer's Lake, where the glacial runoff creates an ethereal blue hue. In the summer, the plains of Mycorzha come alive with a blanket of purple, blue, and pink flowers that bloom in a soft, dreamlike haze. The landscape seems to shimmer under the glow of fireflies, their soft light casting a peaceful, magical aura across the open fields.",

      content: `Greater Mycorzha is a general name for most of the Isles – from the Southern Hills, the Western Plains, and all the way up to Fern Leaf Forest much of Mycorzha is temperate grassland. Given it is such a large area how much food is available for harvest often depends on seasonal crops, leaving much of Greater Mycorzha uninhabited by any permanent residents. This does not mean the land is untouched, the lands are still cultivated and maintained by the many nomadic clans that live on the Isles moving from place to place depending on the season and available crops. The clans all have their own unique cultures and traditions - far too extensive to list here - but every year during high summer they all find themselves at the center of the Isles for the cool glacial water of Dreamer Lake. Here stands a lone tree of immense size which can be seen from far into the Plains, which became known as the Dreamer Tree. Over time the clans began to meet under this tree for trade, simply because it was easy to spot, and eventually the high summer holiday of Arda was born. A time for bonfires, gift exchanges, trade, dancing, and cultural exchange among the clans to celebrate each other as a larger community.

The Plains are interspersed with beautiful patches of blue and purple flowers that can look akin to the sea when all in bloom. Individuals in the various clans began harvesting and drying the flowers long ago originally perhaps for medicinal properties but over time many individuals began to make satchels of the brightly colored flowers to give for Arda. This eventually evolved into the tea trade all throughout the Isles.  Knowledge of foraging and cultivation is central to the nomadic clans to ensure that there are more plants for the future. All the clan residents have immense knowledge of each region of the Isles - at least those south of the mountains. No one goes to the bitter cold north where nothing is said to grow.

Now nearly all the creatures of the Isles make their own blend of herbs, leaves, spices, and flavors to share as a way to say hello, thank you, or a simple happy Arda. Blends are all seen as a personal signature of sorts, a way to share yourself with others that is both personable but open. Herbs and dried plants of all kinds are perhaps perceived as the most valuable commodity on the Isles. Many of the seasonal traders noticed the Mycorzhian's strong interest in various dried plants and began bringing them each harvest season to the delight of the locals.`,
