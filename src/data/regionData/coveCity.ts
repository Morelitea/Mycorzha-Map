    "Bustling with vibrant energy, Cove City thrives in bold hues of every color you could imagine, often clashing against each other to form geometric murals that would brighten any day. Buildings are haphazardly stacked into skyscrapers made from stone, wood, and mud plaster with innovative windows made from stretched jelly mushrooms across wood frames. Here you will find the temples of the Mysts and the Isle, the Mystveil Academy of the Sciences, and an extensive international district where many past traders from the Beyond have come to stay.",

      content: `Much too busy compared to most of the Isles for things like a calm day of foraging or a relaxing morning with incense, Cove City is polite - but direct. Someone always has a place to go and creatures to see. While community culture here is still strong and someone will always lend a helping hand if you need assistance they wont stay around after to visit. They might help a sailor lift a heavy box onto the docks - and then disappear into the crowd before she could turn around to say thank you. The City is so large that many here only interact with their given district, creating several unique subcultures. The City is interspersed with both permanent and transient residents, with new nesting towers built often to ensure there is always somewhere to stay warm during a cold winter night regardless of where you may be from or how long you will be there.

Cove City is nestled into the calm waters of Coral Cap Cove at the end of the Luna River. It is the only true city on the small isles as most residents are unlikely to permanently settle in one location due to the more nomadic nature of those who live in Mycorzha. The creation of the city happened both naturally and haphazardly due to it's convenient location making it accessible both for traders and those who harvested from the fertile Luna Valley area for goods to exchange. Boat homes are built along it's expansive docks with many residents enjoying the access to the ocean and the constant movement that comes with the busy trading areas. Towers are built throughout the city, some having toppled over through the years and repurposed into new homes on the ground. The streets curve in unexpected ways that can make it hard to navigate if you aren't a local, causing many of those who do not live there to stay away from the city all together. For all that it is disorganized in it's city planning much effort has been made to make navigating the city as easy as possible regardless of where you are from. Cove City has official pictograph tiles they use to describe things like street names, goods, and processes throughout rather than using a distinct written language. This makes the city the ideal location for those not from Mycorzha who don't speak the local language. Versions of these pictographs are found at the other trade ports, but unlike Cove City lack any sort of official designation, making the other ports a little more haphazard.

Cove City due to it's many different types of residents boasts a robust nightlife to accommodate the many nocturnal creatures that reside there. The markets never really close, the ports are always running, and even the parks feature many wonderful plants and insects that only come out in the night.

Unique to Cove City is the Mystveil Academy of Sciences. For the most part those of the Mycorzha Isles do not have a strong academic focus - opting instead to learn how to tend to the land and spend their time with their communities. Many never learn to formally read or write as it is never a needed skill, and with stories passed along orally there is always a warm fire and a night of tall tales to be found nearby. However, some with different brains or bodies find themselves naturally fascinated with all the wonderful opportunities and enjoyment these skills can bring. These individuals are celebrated on the island for their unique perspectives, and many chose to leave their communities in favor of living at the Academy surrounded by others who enjoy these same pursuits. The Academy is expansive and known well beyond the Isles for its amazing research. Its curriculum is built to support those of all different backgrounds due to the predominant academic population being differently abled - expansive walkways, raised text, food and residential halls designed to support those who are perhaps to busy with a good book to always remember that they must also eat on occasion.

While many in the city are a bit more disconnected from the land than most, seeing the holidays as nothing more than a time for ridiculously over the top decorations, the Cove City residents wanted to ensure those who grew up there still understood the Isle. As such 7 large parks were built through out the city to represent each of the 7 known biomes the island has and the various ways to care for the plants that grow there (Fern Leaf Forest - taiga forest, Hazelmoss Woods - temperate forest, Greater Mycorzha Plains and Hills - temperate grasslands, Morel Marsh -temperate wetlands, Crescent Mountains - alpine tundra, Luna Valley - open woodland, and the surrounding Oceans - marine aquatic). While there isn't enough food grown in these to feed all the residents of Cove City those who had a bad trade month or are down on their luck are welcome to forage here to get them through tough times. For those truly unable to make it in the trades Luna Valley is nearby and always has room for more creatures.`,

The Mysts are represented in a lot of different ways as the shrines appeared in a very informal matter, but typically speaking involve a small fountain surrounded by a circle meant to represent the Mysts embrace and protection of the Isle. The Isle is often represented instead with artistic structures of netting on top of a mound of porous white rocks that holds up the incense sticks with ease.The City also boasts the only formal temples dedicated to the Mysts and the Isles, run by a select few who dedicate their lives in service of the Gods. The windows on the temples look like stained glass - built using wood framing and stretched colors of various jelly mushrooms - featuring myths of the god the temple is dedicated to. Many hold their weddings in these beautiful temples both due to their artistic nature and because legends say the Mysts and the Isles are themselves the oldest couple in the universe - living and breathing as one.`,

However recently the Cove City Council decided to renovate some areas, for both safety and city improvements. They cleared several areas of collapsing older towers, remnants from early in the city's construction that had long since been abandoned. In their place, the Council decided to showcase new, amazing innovations developed by the Academy and local inventors thanks to recent mushrooms discoveries on the isles. (Read more about Mushroom Magic here) After much debate as to what these wonders would look, like the Council settled on monuments to the thing they all loved most about their beautiful home - gorgeous landscapes filled with fruits, herbs, and more, highlighting the Isles they all knew and loved. There are 7 grand parks in the city featuring the 7 distinct biomes found on the Mycorzha Isles, maintained both by the general population and the dedicated park rangers who teach creatures how to care for the food forests of each biome.

- Crescent Mountains - alpine tundra
- Fern Leaf Forest - taiga forest
- Greater Mycorzha Plains and Hills - temperate grasslands
- Hazelmoss Woods - temperate forest
- Luna Valley - open woodland
- Morel Marsh - temperate wetlands
- Oceans - marine aquatic

The Council, having mostly grown up in the city and away from much of the land, quickly found themselves a bit lost. They put out a posting, requesting the aid of some of the Mycorzhian critters to create a plan. Nalin volunteered immediately, eager to share their knowledge of the Isles, and together with the Council and the Academy the 7 Grand Parks were designed and ground was broken on the project. Large mature trees were shipped in from various regions to be planted, along with many saplings and seeds to recreate the best of Mycorzha right here in the city.`,

Water sprayed into chamber cooled by mushroom magic is blasted into the main areas as snow, turning the whole of the park into a giant, year-round snow globe. Critters enter the park through a chamber which lifts them up to the center at the top of a large hill, meant to represent the terrain of the Crescent Mountains. Copying the vine and pully system that carries baskets up the Luna Valley River for trade, wooden sleds are pulled to the top to sled down. Some creatures choose instead to use the zipline to speed down the hill and enjoy the view from above the trees. Occasionaly critters might actually notice the alpine gardens walk where you can hike down the hill (or up) on a winding pathway and see all the amazing plants that grow here such as Arctic Poppy, Saskatoon Berry, and Pasqueflower.`,

Paths through the thickets and undergrowth let critters enjoy the feeling of being shaded beneath the large trees. An artificial lazy river was dug through the park, showcasing the spawning cycle of the Lanturn Fish, who swim up the Lanturn Glow River at the end of every fall season to lay their eggs in the steaming waters of the Glow Cap Caverns. Using some newly invented plumbing, the city park runs water through rooms filled with hot air from the heat mushrooms, warming the water in the lazy stream to simulate the Glow Cap pools, one of the only natural hot springs on the Isles. These sheltered pools allow for unique glowing mushrooms and algae to grow. The Lanturn fish eat these as babies, causing them to glow like lanturns in the water, a beautiful sight every year as they depart for ocean waters, and return to spawn in the spring. In the park, bioluminescent algae from the caverns was planted on the ground of the "river" in the shape of fish, and critters floating down the river can see pictograph tiles depicting the Lanturn Glowfish spawn cycle.`,

As the Isles has plenty of food and homes for everyone living there there is no need to go to a University to pursue your passions, whatever they may be, freely. As such attendance is not based on prior knowledge and experience but rather based on a clear passion for learning that simply cannot be stopped. Many with this passion are a little different than most in their communities, which pushed them to look at things from a unique perspective.This created a culture at the Academy that prioritizes those who are a little bit different.

A natural geyser came up from the Isles into a pool of sorts that always formed as light mist from the spray and tepid nature of the water. The Mycorzhian critters took to bathing in it's waters to feel connection to the Mysts during high summer when the sky is cleared and her protection if often missed the most. As more and more critters bathed here others chose to stay and ensure the geyser pools stayed clean and became known as the "Speakers of the Mysts". The Speakers built showers to wash in before entering the baths and open air rooms to live in that allowed them to watch over the geyser in any weather. While the Speakers most often keep to themselves they also kindly guide Mycorzhian's through special moments such as celebrating new life. When not helping in the Temple Speakers are expected to extend the protection of the Mysts to all, and so they also help run a nearby hospital and orphanage.`,

This is still seen as fickle as the Mysts staying for too long can cause the crops not to grow well that year due to lack of sunlight, and so Mycorzhian's pray to the Mysts for both protective covering as well as to make way for the sun. The Mysts no matter the time of year circle around the Isles in the distance never fully lifting and so are ever present. Critters come here to wash their newborns in the waters in hopes of protecting them. As the Isles and the Mysts are often considered the first couple, living and breathing as one cycle of both life and death, many get married here in hopes the Mysts will grant their union protection if they wash themselves with its waters. Many will also come to bathe and meditate here before beginning any new stage of life: be that starting an apprenticeship, moving from one community on the Isles to another, or sailors before a journey.`,

The River Critters see the Mysts as the only god who's source is the Fable Falls that feed the Luna Valley River, and so the falls and its mist are painted with the island seemingly spilling out from it and critters forming in the fog. Sailors of the Isles depict the Mysts that surround the Isles, showing a wake of shipwrecks with her cloudy like spear through the hulls and a Mycorzhian ship untouched with the Mysts seeming to open a tunnel for them to sail through. Also shown is a huckleberry bush with a water shrine at it's base and the Mysts clearing just large enough to let in a stream of light so the berries can grow.`,

The Speakers often rely on the offerings from this season to help them maintain the geyser, and the Myst Hospital and Orphanages they help to run.\n\nLumeanar, meant to bring back the warmth of Arda, also comes with many taking bathes in the geysers still tepid waters just as they had in the summer months.`,

Over time a collection of these individuals amassed and with such little understanding of the Isles seemed to often find themselves int trouble. The Mycorzhan's determined that supports needed to be put in place, and so they built the district to provide shelter to traders and stranded travelers alike. Much of the housing here was built haphazardly to ensure there was enough housing for everyone in short order. Over time those in the international district have built on the original buildings to create additional supports, overlaying these beams with art and depictions of home. This hodpodge of culture creates a completely unique area on the Isles with buildings being more square and the creation of a centralized market where temporary stalls are created for trading all kinds of this both from the Isles and the Beyond. The City Council building was built just outside the market, a system of government that originally formed to help figure out what to do with the many stranded Beyonders as well as the rapidly expanding city itself.  Thanks to the formal pictograph system the Council created there is now plenty of support to help Beyonders who land on their shores.`,
